# ScientificCalculator
Scientific Calculator for casual use, equations solving and matrix operations. Simplistic GUI, similar to the integrated Windows Calculator. Made using MATLAB.

Features 3 modes:

Simple algebra operations: +,-,*,/,x^n, root(x), log(x), etc. The mathematical statement can also be input through the keyboard.
Equations Solver: The user can input the degree and the factors of the polynomial and the solver calculates its roots.
Matrix Operations: The user can decide the sizes of two matrices and fill each matrix's cell. Operations as addition, scalar multiplication, multiplication between the 2 matrices, inverse, transpose etc. can be done.
It has been made using App Designer tool of MATLAB and can be installed on Windows.
